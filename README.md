# EVA7-Phase1-Session2.5-PyTorch101

A neural network that takes : 2 inputs:
1. An image from the MNIST dataset (say 5), and
2. A random number between 0 and 9, (say 7)
3. and gives two outputs:

The "number" that was represented by the MNIST image (predict 5), and
The "sum" of this number with the random number and the input image to the network (predict 5 + 7 = 12)
